# Random Cat Image Generator 🐱

This project features a simple web page that generates a new random cat image every time you click a button. It uses the [CATAAS](https://cataas.com/) API to fetch and display these images.

## How It Works

- When you click the button, a new cat image is fetched from the CATAAS API.
- The page displays the new image along with a loading progress bar.
